duraskel - a collection of hardened configurations for new user accounts

For hardened configurations for servers see
[duraconf](https://github.com/ioerror/duraconf)

## Installation

Run `make install` as root.  It needs rsync and it *will* remove
anything you had in /etc/skel.

## Contributions

I'm using gitflow.  Please create your branches from the *develop*
branc.
